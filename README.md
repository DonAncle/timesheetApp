## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To get your Timesheet Auckland Pest application up and running, follow these steps carefully:

### 1. Create the Google Sheet

Start by setting up your central data repository:

* Create a **new Google Sheet**. You can name it whatever you like (e.g., "Company Timesheets").

* Create a new sheet (tab) named `Timesheets`. The **first row must have the following headers exactly**:
    `Email, Date, StartTime, FinishTime, Overtime, Type, Comment, TimesheetID`

* Create another new sheet (tab) named `Employee`. The **first row must have the following headers exactly**:
    `Email, Name, Role, Branch, Division, Payroll ID, Supervisor`

* **[IMPORTANT]** Create a new sheet (tab) named `OrgSetup`. This sheet is crucial for the app's configuration:
    * In cell `A2`, enter your **organization's name**. This will appear in the app's header.
    * In column `B`, starting from cell `B2`, list all your company's **branches**.
    * In column `C`, starting from cell `C2`, list all your company's **divisions**.

### 2. Create the Google Apps Script Project

Integrate the application's code with your Google Sheet:

* In your Google Sheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**. This will open the Apps Script editor. You'll see a default `Code.gs` file.

* **Delete any existing code** in `Code.gs` and replace it with the content from the `Code.gs` file in this repository.

* Create a new **HTML file** by clicking the `+` icon next to "Files" and selecting `HTML`. Name the file `index.html` (be sure to include the `.html` extension). Copy the contents from the `index.html` file in this repository into it.

* Create another new **HTML file** and name it `Sidebar.html`. Copy the contents from the `Sidebar.html` file in this repository into it.

* **Enable the manifest file:**
    * Click on **Project Settings** (the ‚öôÔ∏è icon) on the left.
    * Check the box for "Show 'appsscript.json' manifest file in editor".
    * A new `appsscript.json` file will appear. Replace its contents with the `appsscript.json` file from this repository.

* Click the **Save project icon** (üíæ).

### 3. Deploy the Web App

Make your application accessible:

* At the top right of the Apps Script editor, click the **Deploy** button and select **New deployment**.

* Click the gear icon next to "Select type" and choose **Web app**.

* In the configuration options:
    * **Description:** Give your deployment a name (e.g., "Version 1").
    * **Execute as:** Select `Me`.
    * **Who has access:** Select `Anyone with Google account`.

* Click **Deploy**.

* Google will ask you to **Authorize access**. Follow the prompts. *You may see a screen saying "Google hasn't verified this app." Click `Advanced`, then "Go to [Your Project Name] (unsafe)". Grant the necessary permissions.*

* After authorizing, a "Deployment successfully updated" dialog will appear with a **Web app URL**. This is the link to your timesheet application that you will share with your technicians.
